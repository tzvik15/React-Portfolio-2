# React-Portfolio

## Overview
This is a remake of my portfolio using React.js. 

### Functionality
The user can navigate between 3 main pages: an about me page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. The about page includes several paragraphs about my history and passion, as well as a listing of my technical knowledges. The contact page contains my contact information, as well as a working contact form that, upon submission, sends me an email with the contents. The portfolio page contains several projects I worked on. Hovering on a project name opens a short description of it, and clicking on the project name links to a page discussing the project in more detail, including links to its repo and deployed URL.

### Technology Used
React.js, react-router
